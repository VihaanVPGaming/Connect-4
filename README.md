# Connect 4 :o:
The classic game of Connect 4 and created in Unity.  

Using UI elements and a simple game controller we re-created Connect 4. Players choose either Red or Green, and play! First to get 4 in a row, column, or diagonally, wins!

## Getting Started with editing in Unity :page_with_curl:

_This project was built with Unity 2022.3.21f1_

## Edits Made to Orignal Code :pencil2:
Added TextMeshPro text to the orignal game, fixing the pixelated text. Also added a nice yellow crosshair cursor.
